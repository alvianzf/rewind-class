# About Javascript Functions
JavaScript is a single-threaded language that runs on a main thread (usually within a web browser) to execute code sequentially. This means that if you have multiple tasks or operations to perform in your JavaScript code, they are executed one after the other, in the order they are encountered in your script.

##### Asynchronous functions in JavaScript are a fundamental concept that allows you to perform tasks without blocking the main thread of execution. They are essential for handling operations that might take some time to complete, such as network requests, file reading/writing, and timer-based actions, without causing the application to become unresponsive.

# Asynchronous in Javascript 

### Synchronous
```javascript

function syncFunction() {
    console.log("I am a synchronous function");
    }

syncFunction(); // I am a synchronous function 
console.log('Hello');// Hello

```

### Asynchronous
```javascript
const asyncFunction = () => new Promise((resolve) =>{
    setTimeout(()=>{
        console.log("I am an asynchronous function")
    },200);});

    syncFunction();// I am a synchronous function
    
    setTimeout(syncFunction(),15);// I am an asynchronous function
}
```

---

# Promise
a Promise is an object that represents a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved or rejected at some point in the future. Promises are a fundamental part of asynchronous programming in JavaScript, and they provide a structured way to handle asynchronous operations.

#### Promises has three states:
1. **Pending**: The initial state when a Promise is created, and it hasn't been resolved or rejected yet.  
2. **Fulfilled (Resolved)**: The state when a Promise has successfully completed its operation, and a result value is available.  
3. **Rejected**: The state when a Promise has encountered an error or failed to complete its operation, and an error reason is available.

# Promise
The main advantage of using Promises is their ability to handle asynchronous code in a more structured and readable manner, avoiding callback hell (a situation where multiple nested callbacks make code hard to follow). Here's how you typically create and use a Promise in JavaScript:

```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data from a server)
  setTimeout(() => {
    const success = true;
    if (success) {
      resolve("Data fetched successfully"); // Resolving with a value
    } else {
      reject("Error: Unable to fetch data"); // Rejecting with an error
    }
  }, 2000); // Simulated delay of 2 seconds
});

myPromise
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result); // Data fetched successfully
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error); // Error: Unable to fetch data
  });

```

<!--
We create a Promise using the new Promise() constructor, which takes a function as an argument. This function receives two parameters: resolve and reject, which are functions used to indicate the successful resolution or rejection of the Promise.

Inside the Promise constructor, we simulate an asynchronous operation using setTimeout. Depending on the outcome of the operation (success or failure), we either call resolve with a result or reject with an error.

We then use the .then() method to specify what should happen when the Promise is resolved and the .catch() method to handle any errors if the Promise is rejected.
-->

# `.then()` and `.catch()`
In JavaScript Promises, the .then() and .catch() methods are used to handle the result (fulfillment) and error (rejection) outcomes of a Promise, respectively. These methods allow you to define what should happen when a Promise is resolved successfully (fulfilled) or when it encounters an error (rejected).

```javascript
somePromise
  .then((result) => {
    // Code to handle the successful resolution (fulfillment) of the Promise
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Code to handle the rejection of the Promise (error)
  });

```

# Async - Await in Javascript

`async` functions are like regular JavaScript functions but they return promises instead of using callbacks or returning values directly  
`await` is a keyword that can only be used inside async functions, it will pause execution until promise settles or rejects/

Example   
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function getData() {
    try{
        const response = await axios('https://api.github.com/users');
        return response.data
    } catch(err){
        console.log(`Error ${err}`);
    }
}

getData();
```
It will return 

```javascript
PromiseÂ {<pending>}
```

---

# Async - Await
How would you read the data from the result of the previous function?

<center>
    <h1>Using `.then()`</h1>
</center>

```javascript
getData()
    .then(res => console.log(res))
```
<center>
    <h1>and handle the error using `.catch()`</h1>
</center>


```javascript
getData()
    .then(res => console.log(res))
    .catch(err => console.log(err))
```

# What's the difference between `async await` and `.then()` ?
### Async/Await
- async functions allow you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like style. You use the await keyword within an async function to pause execution until a Promise is resolved or rejected. This makes the code look linear and easier to read, as it resembles traditional synchronous code.

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

---

# What's the difference between `async await` and `.then()` ?
### `.then()`
- The .then() method is used to handle asynchronous operations by chaining callbacks. You attach .then() handlers to Promises to define what should happen when the Promise is fulfilled (resolved) and when it's rejected. This style of coding can lead to nested callbacks, commonly known as "callback hell" or "Pyramid of Doom."

```javascript
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));

```

# The Pyramid of Doom!
a.k.a Callback hell!

The "Pyramid of Doom," also known as "Callback Hell," is a term used in programming to describe a situation where multiple levels of nested callbacks create an indentation pyramid-like structure in your code. This occurs when you have a series of asynchronous operations or callback functions within other callback functions. It can make your code difficult to read, understand, and maintain.

```javascript
asyncFunction1((result1) => {
  // Code that uses result1
  asyncFunction2((result2) => {
    // Code that uses result2
    asyncFunction3((result3) => {
      // Code that uses result3
      asyncFunction4((result4) => {
        // Code that uses result4
        // ...
      });
    });
  });
});

```

# How to Escape the Pyramid of Doom
Using async/wait

To mitigate the Pyramid of Doom, developers often use techniques like Promises and async/await, which provide more structured and readable ways to handle asynchronous code.

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const result1 = await asyncFunction1();
    // Code that uses result1
    const result2 = await asyncFunction2();
    // Code that uses result2
    const result3 = await asyncFunction3();
    // Code that uses result3
    const result4 = await asyncFunction4();
    // Code that uses result4
    // ...
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors
  }
}
```
